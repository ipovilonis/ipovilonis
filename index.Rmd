Hexachlamys edulis (O. Berg) Kausel & D. Legrand,
“ubajay” (H. edulis) is certainly a prominent species,
distributed naturally in an important area of South
America, which provides potentially nutraceutical
fruits, leaves with secondary metabolites of interest,
and other usable organs that provide great benefits
for human health and new alternatives for production systems.
