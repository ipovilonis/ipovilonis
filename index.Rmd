# The problem

In response to population growth, there is an increased demand for a greater diversity of plant species. In addition, the increase in environmental variability resulting from climate change, together with the food crisis observed in recent years, means that farmers and plant breeders will need to have access to an even wider range of plant genetic resources in the future. Accurate and rapid identification of cultivars, as well as recognition of groups with similar genotypes to determine distinctiveness and uniqueness of phenotypic and genetic expression, is the key to improving the performance of cultivars in a practical breeding programs.
Argentina is a country with significant biological diversity, where its great variety of climates offers a highly diversified flora, with around 10,000 plant species, a figure that is in line with almost the entire European flora. However, it is practically unknown, although it is of great importance as an economic, social and cultural heritage. On the other hand, several hundred species remain unused in the world despite being highly resistant to climate adversities such as biotic and abiotic stress and being important donors of genes for crop improvement. In addition, non-traditional and underutilized fruits are considered to play an irreplaceable role in mitigating world food problems in the face of sustainable population growth and malnutrition.

# The species

*Hexachlamys edulis* (O. Berg) Kausel & D. Legrand,
“ubajay” (syn. *Eugenia myrcianthes* Nied.) is certainly a prominent species, distributed naturally in an important area of South
America, which provides potentially nutraceutical
fruits, leaves with secondary metabolites of interest,
and other usable organs that provide great benefits
for human health and new alternatives for production systems.

# Objetive

The morphophysiological, chemical, phenological, reproductive and genetic characterization of the species *Hexachlamys edulis* and its variability in three populations.

# General Methodology

Different reproductive, genetic, phenological, physical and chemical variables will be recorded in three populations of the province of Entre Ríos in Argentina: Concordia, "El Palmar" National Park and the reserve "El Potrero de San Lorenzo" in Gualeguaychú.

![The three populations](https://github.com/ipovilonis/ipovilonis.github.io/blob/main/mappoblacion.jpg?raw=true)

The studies will be conducted in september (Flowering season) and November (Fruiting season) 2019, 2021 and 2022.

Adult genotypes of *H. edulis* (15 to 20 per population) will be selected and characterized at each site. In each season environmental variables will be recorded: precipitation, temperature, soil temperature, humidity and edaphic parameters.

# Expected results

These studies will be an essential contribution for the conservation, subsequent improvement and sustainable use of this species, a fact that will allow the generation of new productive alternatives to agricultural and forestry activities, not only in the area of influence of the species, but also in other areas.
These studies will arouse the interest of producers who seek to adapt their agroecosystems towards sustainable production and be an alternative for diversification. This fact brings advantages in terms of ecosystem services and new marketing possibilities.
In turn, the methodology used will be a further contribution to the following studies on the species as well as within the *Myrtaceae* family.
The results will be a fundamental stimulus for the species to be included in the National Food Code (at least in Argentina).
Obtain publications in the national and international academic-scientific field, either by presenting at Scientific events or by publishing them in high-impact scientific journals and as part of future graduate and postgraduate theses.
In the research process, train scientific vocations with a vision in the conservation and use of plant resources.
